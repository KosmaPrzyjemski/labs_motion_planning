# labs_motion_planning

This project's goal was to simulate robot's planned motion to grab a ball placed inside a box while avoiding obstacles.
Setting up the robot, its environment, adding constraints to robot's movements and running the path planning algo were few of the steps to complete this lab project (reference to the project's creator: https://github.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-practicals).
